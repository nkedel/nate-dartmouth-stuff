# nate-dartmouth-stuff

Old code from my undergrade years.  Probably of absolutely no interest to
anyone, other than nostalgia for me.  

Unless otherwise noted, I release everything here subject to the Mozilla
Public License version 2.

Directory "random-not-mine" is for archived code which I'm no longer sure
if it's downloadable elsewhere; licenses as noted.  For "nh_cpp" see the 
readme, but I assume that's basically the MIT license.
