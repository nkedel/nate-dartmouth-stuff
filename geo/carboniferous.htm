<HR>
<H3>When was it?</H3>
360 to 286 million years ago.<BR>
It is often subdivided into two parts, the Early Carboniferous or Mississippian (260-320 MYA),
and the Late Carboniferous, or Pennsylvanian (320-286 MYA)<P>
<H3>What was going on?</H3>
Lots of trees -- a lot of coal comes from this period. The first reptiles appear.<P>
<H3>What were the continents like?</H3>
Godwanaland and the equatorial continents begin to move together.<P>
<H3>What kind of life existed?</H3>
The first reptiles evolve from Amphibians; the big difference is that reptiles have an
amniote egg -- one with a shell -- that can be left on land, rather than requiring that
the creatures return to the water to breed. Further, plant life continues to evolve into
a great diversity of forms.<HR>
