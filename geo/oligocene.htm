<H3>When was it?</H3>
37 to 24 million years ago.<P>
<H3>What was going on?</H3>
Mammals and birds continue to diversify. The first Anthropoids appear.<P>
<H3>What were the continents like?</H3>
Things look pretty modern, but a lot of the lower areas are under water.  
Africa bumpes into Eurasia, but water covers much of Europe.<P>
<H3>What kind of life existed?</H3>
Mammals and birds continue to diversify and to more closely resemble the modern
forms. The first Anthropoid primates, like Aegyptopithecus, appear; these may be
ancestral to modern Apes, but are less derived than either modern apes or monkeys.
