<H3>When was it?</H3>
4.5 to 3.8 Billion years ago.<P>
<H3>What was going on?</H3>
A lot, geologically. Nothing yet, biologically<BR>
More specifically, the earth was still forming -- during this period, a Mars-size body 
probably collided with the Earth, forming the moon, and liquifying the early crust. Things
were probable pretty nasty. Thus the name, Hadean: "hades-like"<P>
<H3>What were the continents like?</H3>
The continents, as we know them, didn't exist yet; the surface of the earth was still cooling.<P>
<H3>What are sediments from the Hadean like?</H3>
I'm not clear on whether any sediments from the Hadean exist; Stanley refers to both the Hadean 
and Archaean as the Archaean. If they do exist, they'd appear in cratons (very old, very stable parts 
of the crust) just like Archaean rocks do.<P>
<H3>What kind of life existed?</H3>
Nothing that we know of. The earliest known life appears in the next Eon, the Archaean.
