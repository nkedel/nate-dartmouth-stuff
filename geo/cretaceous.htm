<H3>When was it?</H3>
144 to 65 million years ago.<P>
<H3>What was going on?</H3>
Dinosaurs are still big. The first birds evolve. Then the Dinosaurs die out.<P>
<H3>What were the continents like?</H3>
The Atlantic ocean is forming, and the 4 big continents are North America, South America, 
Africa, and Eurasia; Australia, India, and Antarctica are all hanging out near the south
pole.<P>
<H3>What kind of life existed?</H3>
Dinosaurs still fill tons of niches. The first birds evolve from Dinosaurs, like 
Archaeopteryx. Snakes evolve, and more advanced small mammals appear.  Then, at the end of 
the period, a major mass extinction occurs. The dinosaurs, except for their Avian descendants, 
are annihilated, and many other forms of life are greatly reduced in diversity.
