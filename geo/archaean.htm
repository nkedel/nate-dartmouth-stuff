<H3>When was it?</H3>
3.8 to 2.5 Billion years ago.<P>
<H3>What was going on?</H3>
The surface of the earth finally stabilizes enough for life to begin to evolve.<P>
<H3>What were the continents like?</H3>
The continents, as we know them, didn't exist yet; the surface of the earth had cooled off,
but was still much more geologically active than it is today. The continents are still 
forming.<P>
<H3>What are sediments from the Archaean like?</H3>
Archaean sediments appear in cratons  -- very old, very stable parts of the crust. Also,
structures called stromatolites appear, which are very early fossils indicating threadlike
bacteria.<P>
<H3>What kind of life existed?</H3>
Blue-green algae, and probably other simple bacteria and bacteria-like organisms; these 
critters fall into the category called prokaryotes, which are single-celled organisms
lacking a defined nucleus and other infracellular organs. Similar forms of life still 
exist today.
