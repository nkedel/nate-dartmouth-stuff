Directions for compiling the client and server:
-----------------------------------------------

NOTE: You must compile the client and server separately!

Client Directory: ~nate/game/client/
1) run make
2) this will create the executable "game"

Server Directory: ~nate/game/server/
1) run "make clean"
2) run make
3) this will create the executable "gameserv"


Directions for running the client and server:
---------------------------------------------

1) Goto the server directory
2) run the server: gameserv [port]
3) up to 4 clients can connect to this server
4) to run a client go to the client directory
5) run the client: game [servername] [port] [player # 0-3]
	Note: player # 0 must be the last to connect. This starts the game.   

Directions for gameplay:
------------------------
Your character is the highlighted '@'. The goal of the game is to kill the 
other player(s). Use the keypad or arrow keys to move around the map. A '#'
is a wall which you may not walk through. A '~' represents water and is 
another obstacle.
Critical player data including your hit-points, kills, experience, armor 
class, weapons, etc can be seen in the status bar on the right.
