Files:
double.tcl      TCL program to accept user input and see if the word entered
                has double adjacent letters.
double-i.tcl    a slightly "friendlier" version of double.tcl, not quite to
                specification on its user interaction.
Stack.h         Interface to classes IntStackA and IntStackB; version of the 
		original Stack.h modified to include private member values.
Stack.cc        Impementation of classes IntStackA and IntStackB
tester.cc       Simple, noninteractive test facility for IntStack classes.

Implementation decision:
* The key decision I made was to try, whenever possible, to allow failures
(either overruns, etc. or failures on memory allocations, mainly) to be
transparent, and return a message to cerr (stderr) rather than to use
assert; this was both easier for debugging, and somewhat more elegant
(although a still better solution would have been to allow the calling
procedure to check for error itself). In most methods that was possible, but
in the constructor for the Array-based implementation it was not, since it
would be impossible to work around that.

* The tester tests a small stack using visible, predictable numbers, and
then a large stack using a sequence of random numbers, for each
implementation. It then tests the underflow error checking for each of the
implementations, and the overflow checking for the smaller -- overflow for
the larger is virtually impossible to test efficiently, since it is limitted
only by the virtual memory space on the system it is running on.
