FILE:
-----
Makefile       the Makefile automates assembly of the separate parts of
               the program.
README         Readme -- this file, some documentation
DESIGN         Design notes as requested in the homework.
nate.h         defines internal and external interfaces for the game
ttt3D.cc       A driver creating a wish like shell with the new commands
               "ttt3D" and "won3D" using ttt3D_nate and won3D_nate
nate.cc        a single file integrating ttt3D_nate and won3D_nate and their
               supporting functions
nate_test.tcl  test program/driver for new tcl/tk commands (ttt3D and won3D)
nate.tcl       User interface for 3d TicTacToe game
wins.tcl       Generated list of 135 possible win conditions.

Implementation Notes:
---------------------
nate.cc was originally implemented as 4 separate files; the use of the
Makefile (the orignal version of which was provided by Fred Henle) is a
leftover of this, in order to speed recompiles.

inline was used liberally, in the (unproven) hope of improving performance
on frequently called non-recursive functions. Same for use of -O2 compiler
flag.

wins are determined using offset, although within the move selection
routines, a limitted version of the win-detection routine is called which
checks only for wins through a given point, with noticable speed
improvement.

two DEFINES are available at compile time, DEBUG, which enables a lot of
debugging information, and PROFILE, which enables a timer routine to keep
track of the length of thinking time per move.
