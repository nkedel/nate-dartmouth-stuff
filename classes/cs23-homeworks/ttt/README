------------
ttt.cc         derived from "myAppInit.cc" as provided in the class
               contains c++ implementations of the new Tk commands 
               "ttt" and "won" as specified in the homework.

ttt.tcl        heavily derivative of John Danskin's "calc.tcl" provided in
               the class examples.

ttt_test.tcl   simple best-case tester for ttt.cc, tests the "ttt" and
               "won" command implementations

testspd.cc     simple unscientific benchmark program. (not submittied for
               credit)

Design         Some notes on the potential design of a ttt3d implementation
               for homework 4

Implementation notes
--------------------
a) compiling  DEBUG defined will enable a few extra checks, as well as
   messages to STDERR for errors
b) findBest / analyzeX / analyzeY use a single passed by reference copy
   of the board to save copying time and memory.
c) all boards are upper case internally, and the implementations of ttt
   and won will convert incorrect case.
