This will definitely build on Linux; I did the test build on Killington... it
may require a "make depend" to get it to build on a machine with slightly different
libs.  No guarantees that it will build on an Alpha, although it did a long time
ago earlier in testing.

The code-generation phase is essentially 100% non-functional.
